# Computer-Architecture-Project-2023
This project implements the Perceptron predictor in the RISCV BOOM core, creates hybrid combinations of Gshare, TAGE, Alpha and Perceptron, and evaluates all branch predictor implementations using dhrystone, multiplication, qsort and a custom benchmark (recursive function with nested loops)
